World of 2030
World of 2030 is a project created to highlight the current situation of climate change that we are facing, as well as looking
into the future of 2030 and explore what the future may hold. It includes interactive elements such as graphs, videos, images etc. 

Motivation
This project has been created for an assignment, however, this doesn't take away from the message that I am trying to convey on
the impact climate change has had on the previous decade, and what to possibly expect next.
