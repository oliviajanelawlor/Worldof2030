  <br>NASA reports that scientists have attributed the global warming trend to the human
  expansion of the "greenhouse effect" - warming that results when the atmosphere
  traps heat radiating from Earth towards space.<br>

  <br>Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases
  that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere do not respond physically or
  chemically to changes in temperature. These are described as "forcing" climate change.<br>
  <br>Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:

  On earth, human activities are changing the natural greenhouse. Over the last century,
  the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of
  atmospheric <b>carbon dioxide</b>. This happens because the coal/oil burning process
  combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of
  land for agriculture, industry and other human activities has increased the amount
  of greenhouse gases.<br>

  <br> We have already explored the impact of climate change and global warming,
  with warmer conditions, melting glaciers, increasing sea levels.

  <div id="subhead">Our impact</div>

<div id="bodytext">
  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that there is a more than
  95% probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our planet.<br>

  <br> The industrial activities that many of our every day-to-day tasks depend on
  has raised Carbon Dioxide levels from 280 parts per million to <b>400 parts per million</b>
  in the last 150 years.<br>

  <br> Since 1850, almost all the long-term warming can be explained by green house
  gas emissions and other human activities, <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-why-scientists-think-100-of-global-warming-is-due-to-humans">

  <br> Below, you can see the share of Carbon Dioxide emissions from fuel
  combustion derived from each sector from 2014.

    <br> The Paris Climate Agreement (Paris Agreement Under the United Nations Framework
    Convention on Climate Change is an international treaty which aims to reduce the emission
    of gases that contribute to global warming. Named after the country it was adopted in,
    went into force on November 4th 2016 and has since been signed by 197 countries. By
    November 2019, 187 of those countries had ratified to the agreement.<br>


  <div id="quote"><br>‚ÄúThe central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of
          climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well
          below 2¬∞C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the
          temperature increase even further to 1.5¬∞C.‚Äù<br>

        <br> However, a year after the Paris Agreement came into force, CO‚ÇÇ emissions
        still continued to increase, with <b>China's</b> carbon dioxide emissions increasing by

  <br> In December 2019, <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/">Climate Action Tracker</a>
  updated their data, tracking governments as they update their Paris agreement
  targets and pointing out the countries that are not meeting the targets.<br>

  <br> Of the countries that Climate Action Tracker has the data for
  that signed the Paris Climate Agreement, they are ranked on a system from
  <b>Critically Insufficient</b> to <b>Role Model.</b> Below is an example of the
  rating system with some key facts as of December 2019.

            <br> Evident from the infographic, nobody has yet
            reached the <b>"Role Model"</b> rank as of yet. Additionally, the
            5 countries that emitted the most carbon dioxide in 2017 have all
            remained in the same rating since 2017.<br>

            <br> Furthermore, President of the United States, Donald Trump,
            formally announced his intention to withdraw the country in 2017 from
            the Paris climate agreement, which will leave America as the only
            country on Earth not involved within the agreement.<br>

            Paris agreement and the data that Climate Action Tracker has. The latest
            data available was from <b>2nd December 2019.</b><br>
