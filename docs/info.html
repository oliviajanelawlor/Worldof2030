<br>This decade we have witnessed sea levels rising, approximately 89% of
The Great Barrier Reef is dead or dying, wildfires, heatwaves, tropical cyclones
and flooding. Not only has this seen devastation within environments throughout
the world, but there has been a significant loss of life and economic losses due
to these effects of climate change.<br>

<h2>Natural disasters & Increasing temperatures</h2>

  <br> Although natural disasters cannot be directly linked to being an impact
  of climate change, scientists have predicted that <br>

<br>Climate change is nothing new on Earth, which can be seen in the
geological record. The concern now is the rapid rate and size that climate change
is occurring now. <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-do-we-know-climate-changing-1?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products">USGS</a>
explains that the scientific community is aware of the Earth's climate change
because of the trends seen in instrumented climate record and the changes observed
in physical and biological systems. <br>


<div id="quote"><br>"The instrumental record of climate change is derived from thousands of temperature
  and precipitation recording stations around the world. We have very high confidence
  in these records as a whole. The evidence of a warming trend over the past century
  is unequivocal."<br>

<br>With increasing temperatures each year, 2018 was the fourth warmest year since 1880
according to NASA, NOAA, with global temperatures being 0.83 warmer than the 1951
to 1980 mean.<br>

  <br>Possibly continuing to increase, the first month of 2019 was characterised by
  warmer-than-average conditions across much of the worlds surface, with the
  most notable warm temperature anomalies being present across much of Australia
  and parts of north-eastern and south-western Asia. The temperature
  departures from average were 4.0Â°C above average or higher.<br>

<h2>What is the importance of these temperatures?<br></h2>

  <div id="bodytext">Scientists say that the temperatures are rising worldwide
  due to greenhouse gases trapping more heat into the atmosphere. A visible impact of this
  is that droughts are becoming longer and more extreme around the world, tropical storms
  are becoming more severe due to warmer ocean water temperatures and sea levels are rising,
  threatening coastal communities.<br>

  <br> There have been far too many natural disasters, that could have been a possible
  impact of climate change, to name. However, the current ongoing natural disaster occurring
  is the bush-fires currently engulfing much of New South Wales in Australia.<br>

  <br> To give a glimpse into the devastation caused by the bush-fires, below shows
  a satellite view comparison of Australia's New South Wales in 2016, compared to now.<br>

    <center>The bushfires began in late August 2019 with multiple states experiencing bushfires.<br>
    By December 21st 2019, the fires had burnt over <b>3,000,000 hectares</b>,<b>
    destroyed over 700 houses</b> and <b>killed at least 9 people with one unaccounted
    for</b>.<br>

    <br>As of December 29th 2019, almost 100 fires burning across Australia, many uncontained and
    continuing to threaten lives. Some flames have been reported to be as high as
    70m in height, 5m taller than the Sydney Opera House. <br>

    <br>Smoke from these fires have also reached Sydney, causing severe air pollution
    in the country's largest city.<br>

    <br> It was reported that the Australian authorities were concerned that the
    bushfires could jeopardize Sydney's drinking water supply from direct damage
    from the fire as well as contamination risk from ash run-off.<br>
