    <center><br>The 2020s were a decade of climate shocks,
    which spurred the world into action. It was astonishing how quickly things began
    to fall apart: large numbers of deaths resulting from food shortages in central
    India, hundreds of thousands displaced by storm surge vents across Asia, to name
    but a few.<br>
    <br> By the middle of the decade, powerful investors and reinsurance companies
    had realised that the financial implications of climate change were massive.
    Through new investment strategies and intensive influencing from these
    powerful voices, governments and businesses took a global U-turn in the
    fight on climate change. <br>
    <br>Emissions still have not peaked but by 2030 have levelled off, and are expected
    to begin dropping in the next 3 years. Despite this turnaround, there is
    still concern that we could breach the 2C threshold.<br></center>

  <div id="bodytext2">
    <br>As we enter the 30s, there is a global ban on fossil fuel subsidies and
    the use of coal, which is a drastic change from what the world was originally
    used to.<br>
    <br>All new cars must be electric â€“ all of which is monitored by UN Country Special
    Rapporteurs. These actions are beginning to bear fruit: oil demand is plummeting, 40% of
    the cars on our roads are electric or hybrid, and there is a major focus on making
    agriculture carbon positive, as agriculture was once a big emitter of CO2 emissions.<br></div>


<div id="charttitle"><br>The video below, created by BBC Ideas in 2019 gave an insight
  to the public what the world could be like without fossil fuels.<br></div>

<div id="bodytext2">
  <br>The world is comprised of regionally-based economies, but with strong oversight by the
  UN on global issues like climate change, poverty, and water scarcity.<br>

  <br>Carbon prices are in place in most countries, and average $70/tCO2e in 2030,
  incentivising investment in zero carbon solutions.<br>

  <br> Renewables generate more than half of all energy globally. Over 65%
  of power use on a global scale is generated from sun and wind energy.<br>

  <br>It looks as though we will be able to meet a number of the SDGs, including
  gender equality and reduced inequality, however many other SDGs especially with
  strong ties to environmental sustainability such as clean water for all have not
  been reached.<br>
</div>

<hr class="new">

<div id="subhead">A change in business and wealth</div>

  <div id="bodytext2">
    <br>Economies are more regionalised with a greater number of
    small scale businesses with regional supply chains making more economic and
    environmental sense.<br>
    <br>Regions are very digitally connected, which is creating
    strong communities of interest. This makes for more democratic, participatory
    politics where digital pressure groups influence on key issues across national borders.<br>
    <br>Certain cities have emerged as powerful and influential mayors from places
    like San Francisco, Melbourne, KL and St Petersburg are sending representatives to the UN now.<br>

    <br>Global economic growth has on average slowed down significantly and GDP
    is no longer the metric of choice in many places. Societies track progress against
    the SDGs alongside material wealth. The rapid carbon reduction of the late 2020s
    has led to the adoption of a â€˜post-consumeristâ€™ paradigm. We are economically poorer
    overall, but richer in social equality terms.<br>

<div id="subhead">Concentration on the larger businesses</div>

<div id="bodytext2">
    <br>Large businesses are still influential within society, but only those that can demonstrate
    strong environmental sustainability and full transparency across supply chains. Natural
    capital accounting is mandatory in many countries.<br>
    <br>Because the pressure coming from investors and governments is focused on
    decarbonisation and adaptation to climate change, we are failing to mobilise adequately on
     issues like biodiversity loss. As a result are witnessing some <b>major extinction events by 2030</b>,
     including the Hawksbill Turtle and the Black Rhino.<br>
     <br>Man-made structures are being installed in oceans to boost
    coral growth.<br>

<br><div id="bodytext3"><b>In 2019</b>, the Black Rhino and the Hawksbill Sea Turtle were
reported almost extinct. For the black rhino, poaching represents one of the biggest
threats to the survival of the rhino, as its horn is used in traditional folk medicine in China.<br>
As for the Hawksbill Sea Turtle, it grows slowly and breeds rarely, which,
coupled with human hunting, drove the species to the brink. The turtles were exploited
for food and trinkets, putting wild populations continually in danger.

<div id="subhead">Sharing is Caring</div>
<br>
<div id="bodytext2">
  The sharing economy dominates â€“ ownership of many personal use goods, such as cars,
is down significantly. Social credit systems, similar to a credit score, are widespread as
people track their skills, reputation, and adherence to certain values. These are important
currencies in the sharing economy.<br> </div>

      <br><div id="description">
        <div id="description2">Sharing Economy</div>An economic system where assests or services <b>(AirBNB)</b>
          are shared between private individuals, either for free or for a certain price,
          typically by utilising the internet. It comes from the notion that mutual parties
          can share value from an under-utilised skill or asset.<br>

<div id="bodytext2">
<br>
Back in 2019, it was considered the <a href="https://foodrevolution.org/blog/vegan-statistics-global/">"Year of Veganism"</a>.
In Great Britain, the number of vegans in Great Britain quadrupled between 2014
and 2019.<br>
<br><center><b>Now, in 2030,</b> vegetarianism is approaching the 50% mark globally.<br></center>

<br>Responding to decades of information bombardment, advertising, and digital interaction,
generations Z and Alpha seek a greater sense of time, experience and connection, which
is just as well because they lack disposable income.<br>

</div>

<br>

  <div id="subhead">However</div>

  <div id="bodytext2">
    <br>There are pockets of social unrest from those who refuse to adapt to living
    with less, including many on the radical right in the US and Europe and communities
    that couldn't adapt to the decarbonisation agenda. These include many coal
    mining communities in countries such as Indonesia, Australia, the U.S. and Russia.<br>
    <br>There are pockets of the uber-rich who lay low because it is risky to be
    seen as engaging in conspicuous consumption.

    <br>

    <div id="subhead">A fresh development</div>

    <div id="bodytext2">
      <br>Progress on global farming systems was achieved through the sharing of best practice
      and a move away from irrigation-fed agriculture, often by using low-tech innovations.

      Community-managed forests, which were created to mitigate the increasing
      deforestation and forest degradation to address the negative impacts on rural
      livelihoods, now flourish in areas where soil erosion was a key issue
      previously.<br>

      <br>In large part due to carbon pricing policies, <b>over 65%</b> of power use on a
      global scale is generated from sun and wind energy.

    <div id="subhead">Fashion is still important</div>

      <div id="bodytext2">
        <br>In the previous decade, it was well-known that fashion had a devastating
        impact on the environment, with it being the second-largest polluter in the world
        after the oil industry. Companies were over-creating seasonal collections,
        consumers became wasteful in the number of garments that are discarded,
        the amount of water fashion consumed and plastics and emissions it emits into both the atmosphere
        and the ocean devastated the environment. Not only did the environment suffer,
        but human rights were abused and companies disregarded the safety of their workers.<br>

        <br>Methods of designing, creating and using clothes have changed in 2030, but the ideals
        surrounding fashion remains. Fashion continues to have an important function in societies,
        clothing is treasured and kept for a long time, as well as passed down within family and friend groups.<br>

        <br>Sharing networks, enabled by the social credit system proliferate. We
        began to see this in 2018 with the creation of <a href="https://tulerie.com/">Tulerie.</a>
        Although it wasn't the first to allow people to rent high-end clothes and accessories, it was the
        first platform to allow peer-to-peer sharing and renting clothes. How amazing
        that it is now just the norm?!<br>

        <br>Knowing how and where something is produced is highly desirable.
        This set of customer preferences â€“ combined with regionalised production
        levels and lower levels of income inequality overall â€“ means that labour
        exploitation is much less of an issue than in the past. Producers face heavy
        fines for lack of compliance with strict pollution, emissions and working
        condition laws.<br>

        <br>There is a global ban on fur, as well as a very small market for leather, using hides that are a
        by-product of a much smaller global meat industry. Additionally, they may be recycled from other industries such
        as home goods and the auto industry. But a small contraband market for materials like
        fur persists, fuelled by the ultra-rich unwilling to give up these â€˜luxuriesâ€™.<br>
